# 🚗 Road Accident Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Road Accident Dashboard** is an interactive Tableau visualization that provides insights into road accident trends, causes, and severity. The dashboard aims to help authorities, policymakers, and analysts understand accident patterns and take data-driven decisions to improve road safety.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze accident trends over time.  
- Identify accident-prone locations using geospatial analysis.  
- Understand the primary causes and severity of accidents.  
- Provide interactive filtering options for deeper insights.  

## 📊 Features
